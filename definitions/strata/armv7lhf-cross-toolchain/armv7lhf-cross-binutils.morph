  # The TARGET used is the final triplet we expect, rather than that
  # of the libc-less GCC we build, since the binutils only needs to
  # be built once.
  # This requires extra effort to get the stage 1 GCC to use these
  # tools, but saves having an extra binutils build.

  # 1. Binutils gets installed in the default sysroot path of
  #    $PREFIX/$TARGET/{bin,lib}, with the actual sysroot at
  #    $PREFIX/$TARGET/sys-root and its tools also available as
  #    $PREFIX/bin/$TARGET-$tool
  # 2. The '=' makes the path we give relative to the sysroot.
