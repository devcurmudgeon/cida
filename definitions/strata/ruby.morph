  Ruby and common Ruby build dependencies.

  Most Gem dependencies are not required when building or installing the
  Gem. They are needed at runtime only. Tools which extend Rake, such as
  'hoe' and 'rake-compiler', are exceptions to that rule, and are kept
  in this stratum so they are always available when building other Gems.
