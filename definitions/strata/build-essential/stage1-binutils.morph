# We set the sysroot location dynamically at runtime by passing
# `--sysroot` to GCC, so we need to build a linker with sysroot support.
# We set it to a non-existent directory as a safety net to avoid looking
# at the host dirs in case we forget to set the sysroot.  Setting the
# lib path is vital to avoid the tools we build linking to the libraries
# on the host system; the '=' makes the path we give relative to the
# sysroot, which we can then set at runtime by passing -Wl,--sysroot to
# GCC.  Although nothing should be installed on /lib64, we configure the
# linker to look at that directory as well to make things more robust
# (currently GCC installs libraries to this directory at least on
# x86_64).
