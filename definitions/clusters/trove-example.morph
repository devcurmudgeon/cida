  This is an example cluster morphology for deploying a Trove,
  both the initial deployment and an upgrade.

  You need some ssh keys, which you can create like this:

      mkdir ssh_keys
      ssh-keygen -N '' -f ssh_keys/lorry.key
      ssh-keygen -N '' -f ssh_keys/worker.key
      ssh-keygen -N '' -f ssh_keys/trove-admin.key

  You may also put in your own keys instead of creating new ones.

  To do the initial deployment:

      morph deploy clusters/trove-example.morph \
          initial \
          initial.location=kvm+ssh://liw@192.168.122.1/test-trove/tmp/test-trove.img

  To do an upgrade:

      morph deploy clusters/trove-example.morph \
          upgrade upgrade.VERSION_LABEL=123

  where `VERSION_LABEL` gets a new unique value each time.

  Remember to always specify either initial or upgrade as the
  deployment name to use, otherwise morph will attempt to deploy both.
