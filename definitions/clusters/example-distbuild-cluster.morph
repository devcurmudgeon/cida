description: |
  This is an example cluster morph that can be adapted to set up a
  Baserock distributed build network.

  You will need to deploy a Trove for the distributed build network
  to use before deploying this cluster. The worker SSH key file should
  be generated as part of the Trove deployment. It is the key used by
  workers to authenticate with the Trove to give them read access to
  all source repositories.
