  This is a cluster morphology for deploying a x86_64 OpenStack system
  all-in-one-node.

  Requirements to be able to run and test the system:

  - DISK_SIZE should be bigger than 5G
  - The system has to have available at least 4G of RAM, but once
    you start instantiating VMs you will need more.
  - The IP of the system can't change, and you need to know it beforehand,
    that is, the system needs a static IP address.

  This cluster is configurable, but with the following constraints:

  - The hostname in RABBITMQ_HOST has to match CONTROLLER_HOST_ADDRESS,
    and HOST_CONTROLLER.
  - HOSTS_CONTROLLER is only needed if the hostname (see previous point)
    is not a FQDN.
  - The IP listed in MANAGEMENT_INTERFACE_IP_ADDRESS has to match the one
    used in HOSTS_CONTROLLER.
  - CINDER_DEVICE should be a path to a storage device ready to be
    used/formated for cinder data.
  - EXTERNAL_INTERFACE is required when the system has more than one network
    interface.

  You can also have a look at the following suggestions:

  - NOVA_VIRT_TYPE can be either 'kvm' or 'qemu', depending on where the
    system is being deployed to.
  - We recommend changing all the PASSWORDs variables, also the
    KEYSTONE_TEMPORARY_ADMIN_TOKEN, METADATA_PROXY_SHARED_SECRET and
    METERING_SECRET
  - Setting NOVA_BAREMETAL_SCHEDULING with an YAML truth value will configure
    Nova to schedule baremetal machines through the Ironic driver, instead of
    sheduling virtual machines.
