README for morphs
=================

These are some morphologies for Baserock. Baserock is a system
for developing embedded and appliance Linux systems. For
more information, see <http://wiki.baserock.org>.

The systems listed in the systems/ directory are example systems
that build and run at some point. The only ones we can be sure
that still build in current master of definitions are the ones that
we keep building in our ci system; they are listed in
http://git.baserock.org/cgi-bin/cgit.cgi/baserock/baserock/definitions.git/tree/clusters/ci.morph
