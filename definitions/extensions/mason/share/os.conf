# OpenStack. However, the file obtained from there sets OS_PASSWORD
# such that it will ask the user for a password, so you will need to

# With the addition of Keystone, to use an openstack cloud you should
# authenticate against keystone, which returns a **Token** and **Service
# Catalog**.  The catalog contains the endpoint for all services the
# user/tenant has access to - including nova, glance, keystone, swift.
#
# *NOTE*: Using the 2.0 *auth api* does not mean that compute api is 2.0.  We
# will use the 1.1 *compute api*
