    Install a set of files onto a system

    To use this extension you create a directory of files you want to install
    onto the target system.

    In this example we want to copy some ssh keys onto a system

        % mkdir sshkeyfiles
        % mkdir -p sshkeyfiles/root/.ssh
        % cp id_rsa sshkeyfiles/root/.ssh
        % cp id_rsa.pub sshkeyfiles/root/.ssh

    Now we need to create a manifest file to set the file modes
    and persmissions. The manifest file should be created inside the
    directory that contains the files we're trying to install.

        cat << EOF > sshkeyfiles/manifest
        0040755 0 0 /root/.ssh
        0100600 0 0 /root/.ssh/id_rsa
        0100644 0 0 /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
        EOF

    Then we add the path to our manifest to our cluster morph,
    this path should be relative to the system definitions repository.

        INSTALL_FILES: sshkeysfiles/manifest

    More generally entries in the manifest are formatted as:
        [overwrite] <octal mode> <uid decimal> <gid decimal> <filename>

    NOTE: Directories on the target must be created if they do not exist.

    The extension supports files, symlinks and directories.

    For example,

        0100644 0 0 /etc/issue

    creates a regular file at /etc/issue with 644 permissions,
    uid 0 and gid 0, if the file doesn't already exist.

        overwrite 0100644 0 0 /etc/issue

    creates a regular file at /etc/issue with 644 permissions,
    uid 0 and gid 0, if the file already exists it is overwritten.

        0100755 0 0 /usr/bin/foo

    creates an executable file at /usr/bin/foo

        0040755 0 0 /etc/foodir

    creates a directory with 755 permissions

        0120000 0 0 /usr/bin/bar

    creates a symlink at /usr/bin/bar

    NOTE: You will still need to make a symlink in the manifest directory.
