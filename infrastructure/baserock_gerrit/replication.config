# Configuration for gerrit-replication plugin.

# This handles pushing changes from gerrit.baserock.org to git.baserock.org.

  # future. But right now there are hundreds of personal branches and I want to
  # avoid potential push errors for branches we don't care about.

  # If true, gerrit-replication will remove remote branches that are absent in

  # the 'master'. Note that if you set 'authGroup', branches that are not
  # visible to the configured authorisation group will also be removed. So do
  # not set 'authGroup' to anything.
