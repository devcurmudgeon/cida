# Top-level access controls for projects on Baserock Gerrit.

# These can be overridden by a project's own project.config file. They are also
# overridden by the config of a project's parent repo, if it is set to something
# other than the default parent project 'All-Projects'.

# Useful references:
#
#   https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.11/access-control.html
#   https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack-infra/system-config/tree/doc/source/gerrit.rst

# To deploy changes to this file, you need to manually commit it and push it to
# the 'refs/meta/config' ref of the All-Projects repo in Gerrit.
