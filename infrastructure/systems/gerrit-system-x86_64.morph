  System for running Gerrit on Baserock.

  Note this system doesn't contain Gerrit or Java: the Baserock reference
  definitions don't have any support for Java yet. Instead, Java and Gerrit
  are downloaded from the web and installed on first-boot by the configuration
  management scripts.

  So this system is really just a Baserock base system plus
  Ansible and some extras.
