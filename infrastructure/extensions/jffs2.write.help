    Creates a system produced by Morph build with a jffs2 filesystem and then
    writes to an image. To use this extension, the host system must have access
    to mkfs.jffs2 which is provided in the mtd-utilities.morph stratum.

    Parameters:

    * location: the pathname of the disk image to be created/upgraded, or the
      path to the physical device.

    * ERASE_BLOCK: the erase block size of the target system, which can be
      found in '/sys/class/mtd/mtdx/erasesize'
